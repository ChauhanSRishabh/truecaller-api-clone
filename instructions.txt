Our root directory and contains all the project related code, configuration and environment. 

It contains two sub-directories api and .venv.

api directory contains all the source code related to our API.
It has three files:
_init_.py - Initializes our app and databases
models.py - contains the classes/models for our database
views.py - contains the endpoints for our API.

.venv is the virtual environment for the project(haven't included it)
database.db is our database
run.py file is the main file which is executed first whenever the application is started.
requirements.txt contains all the dependencies of the project.

Create the virtual environment
$ python3 -m venv .venv

Activate the virtual environment
$ source .venv/bin/activate

Install flask using pip3
$ pip3 install flask

Install flask_sqlalchemy using pip3
$ pip3 install flask_sqlalchemy

To see the project working, execute these 3 commands while being in the virtual environment:
$ export FLASK_APP=run.py    
$ export FLASK_ENV=development  
$ flask run


Every time a user registers and then logs-in, a unique authentication token is generated for the session which is shown to the user with a message saying "You are logged in successfully". 
The user must remember/save it. 
Once logged in we have to pass this token for each Request method(be it GET, PATCH, POST) for all the endpoints in our API.

How to pass the token:
We give the auth_token through the Headers section in the Postman App before sending any request for any Endpoint.
Choose request method -> enter request URL -> choose Headers from the section below the URL field
Inside Headers, choose Key:"Authorization" and Value:"auth_token" that was displayed when you logged in.
Hit Send
